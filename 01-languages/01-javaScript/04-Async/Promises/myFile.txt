Welcome to Dalaktronixs Research Group,

There are three major states for promises, they are:
* Pending state: This is the default state. The asynchronous hasnâ€™t completed yet  
* Fulfilled State: The operation completed successfully, and resolved(value) was called. You handle the result using .then() method
* Rejected State: The operation failed, and  rejected(reason) was called. You handle the error using the .catch() method.
